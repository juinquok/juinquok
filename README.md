### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate in Information Systems majoring in software development and business analytics! I enjoy exploring cloud technologies and machine learning alongside my work in software development. Currently trying to contribute to the community by making code snippets and various cloud deployments I've done public :) Feel free to raise an issue and ask away :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about software development for cloud deployments
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Terraform with AWS and software development in Java
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making more AWS deployments available as Terraform templates
